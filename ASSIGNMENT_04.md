## Description of project design challenge, target users, research method(s)

### DESIGN CHALLENGE
Acquisition of musical instrument learning has been linked to an increased IQ and ability to learn in young people. However, lack of availability, transportation, and engagement makes it difficult for children in low income families to reap such rewards. The average piano lesson for an individual in 2020 is $60 an hour, meaning family could easily spend $3,000 on piano lessons in a year. In addition, most parents are expected to wait for the duration of the lesson, a privilege many working parents do not have. The premise of this project is to simplify the feedback process, and provide a platform for these students to upload audio or video recordings of themselves for evaluation. Instructors or even intermediate students could give feedback of what could be improved during the recordings.

### TARGET USERS
USER #1 Children - Young People
These users would have working parents who have the income to buy an instrument, but not enough to sustain weekly lessons. They would express an interest to learn an instrument, but simply do not have the means to attend weekly lessons. They maybe farther away (geographically) from nearby musical instructors.
USER #2 Evaluator (older, musically trained) These users must be able to distinguish errors/areas of improvement through visual/audio recordings. However, they would probably on the lower end of expertise (might be using the app to build credibility).

# RESEARCH METHODS
I will be using a participatory observation in combination with a background interview. I will ask the participants for some background on their music capabilities.

#INTRO
Hello! My name is Vanessa. I'm UX researcher interested in making feedback more accessible to aspiring musicians. The purpose of this exercise is to see how musicians feel about recording themselves and about evaluating other musicians. I will ask you a few questions based on your music background, and on your role (as a recorder or as an evaluator). Any questions?

### BASIC INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
1. What would you classify your music level as?
2. How did you begin learning how to play your musical instrument?
3. How do you feel like your method of learning influenced your ability today?
4. What is the most challenging aspect of learning how to play an instrument?

### USER #1 INTERVIEW QUESTIONS 
1. Does recording yourself affect your musical performance?
2. Were you satisfied with your recording?

### USER #2 INTERVIEW QUESTIONS 
1. How would you critique this performance?
2. How did the visual/audio process affect your critique (did it hinder your ability)?
3. Did you rely more heavily on visuals or on audio?

##Your interview transcript or observation notes
### USER #1 - RECORDING

Mmmm I’d say I’m beginner-intermediate. I’m self taught. Not very technical, I learned theory way too late )only learned to create basic solos recently. It’s pretty difficult to understand the theory behind what you’re playing, which is a challenge, but is also often the most rewarding part. Recording honestly wasn’t too bad, there were a few parts where I felt like a made a mistake, but I didn’t want to start over so I kept going. Maybe if I were just starting out, I would be more self-conscious, but it wasn’t too bad.

### USER #2 - CRITQUE
So he definitely needs to work on his timing . . .
He’s mostly rushing
But it still does seem like he needs to memorize the solo more so he can focus on some of the little movements and accents more.
Right now he’s playing the notes he is hitting properly very straight.
I would suggest trying it a little slower and in chunks and really focus on like his attacks
Bc of course
If you can play it slow . . .
Well tone he just didn’t really work on it

I’d classify my musical level as advanced (as in even when my technical ability at a particular time is worse from not practicing, I’m equipped with a good deal of potentiality from my base skill set). And I would say this followed largely from being formally taught a lot of those base skills. I primarily learned in a regular, individual setting but critically also with supplementary group instruction. And I’d say the most challenging part is internalizing those patterns of discipline and supplying that with enough personal volition and wonder to actually want to play it.


## Short reflection on what you learned and what you will do differently in the future.
I expected there to be greater friction between the first user, but it was actually the second user (the evaluator) who had main concerns. It was an intersting persepctive, as after the interview was over, they had mentioned that they saw other evaluators being too harsh with the recordings, and that it would be difficult to screen for objectivity. If I had more time I would like to see how the first user (the recorder) reacts to and the evaluation given, and if the evaluation was helpful, and if they could improve. It would also be interesting to see how musical players at different levels may have different perspectives. I would have also liked to meet up with them in person, as the interview was conducted over phone. This was a logistcal problem, as it is the middle of midterm season and it was difficult to get a hold of people. I addition, the evaluator (who is my friend and is a collegiate level orchestra) lives in San Diego, but I wanted to interview him specifically because I knew he most fit the target audience of an evaluator.
