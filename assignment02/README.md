## Purpose of User Testing
Although I orginally wanted to test the CCLE mobile app, I found it difficult to implement screen sharing on my phone (which is a bit old and glitchy), and so I decided to test the CCLE desktop website instead. I specifically wanted a user who had not used CCLE before, so I asked my friend (who attends Pierce Community College) to help test the application. This was to ensure fresh eyes for the test. The purpose of my user testing was to review flexibility and efficiency of use and visability of system statuses, and based my tasks to measure these specifically. For my tasks, I wanted to focus on common interactions students have with their courses: 1) Finding test dates, 2) Reviewing grades, 3) Contacting the professor. Reviewing grades would test CCLE's ability to show system statuses (are the assignments not submitted, submitted, graded, etc.) All tasks can be done on the website, and I wanted to see the user's efficiency (how long did it take for them to navigate through and complete the task?) As college students, it's important for these interactions to be as smooth as possible.

## Reflection of User Testing
It was interesting to observe a non-UCLA user interact with CCLE, as it has become very familiar to most of my peers and me. The talking out loud process went fairly well, and I felt like I was able to ask decent follow up questions. I noticed that the user did not want to follow external links, perfering to find all information within the application (for example, not using an external link to view the syllabus and finding the information some other way. In the future, I would like to have the user interact with other courses, and test how they feel about possible discrepancies between different courses. Ideally, as stated above, I would like to conduct the test with the CCLE mobile app, as there could be more to improve on. I would also like to test it with incoming freshman, as CCLE will contain information on their courses (the user had to navigate the site with my courses listed).
