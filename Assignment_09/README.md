# Harmony: An App for Music Learning (Vanessa Ta)

# Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
The premise of this project is to simplify the feedback process, and provide a platform for these students to upload audio or video recordings of themselves for evaluation. Instructors or even intermediate students could give feedback of what could be improved during the recordings. Our user-search saw that this reviewal system could be quite helpful. The personas include the student, the evaluator, and the parent, and each persona has a unique view of the app. In this case, we will be focusing on the view of the student. The usage scenario imagines a student organizing and interacting with their own portfolio, a collection of recordings throughout their musical journey. We will be focusing on the following features: 
The ability to play a recording.
The ability to filter through recordings by certain criteria.
The ability to record and edit a performance.
The ability to organize oneâ€™s portfolio by creating folders
