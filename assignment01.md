#CCLE

##Motivation + Description
I will be conducting a heuristic evaluation of CCLE, or Common Collaboration and Learning Environment, a service offered by UCLA to the student body. CCLE exclusively serves the community of UCLA students, and exists both on desktop and on mobile. I will be reviewing the mobile version, as I see a lot of potential for the app's use (CCLE is one of my most visited sites on desktop), yet I don't see many of my peers using it. My peers are always on the go, and need to be constantly on track of assignments and other test dates, so finding ways to improve the app could also improve the general workflow of students.

I will also be conducting a review of the Target desktop website. This is simply due to my own personal love of Target, and its accessibility for UCLA students with its location in Westwood.

Overall Impression:
The app more resembled a text document than it did an app. Organization was a huge hinderence in the app, and there was a lot of nested information and links to get to. The user was given very little autonomy, which was very frustrating when it came to the calendar and reminders feature. It was also unnecesarily cluttered, and as a user it was difficult for me to imagine what the primary use of the app should be.

##1: Visibility of system status
###CCLE
Severity rating: (3)
There are two places where visibility of system statuses could be used, but aren't. The first is in the submission process when turning in assignments. There is no clear indication of the number of steps this process would take, nor any signal to the user of where they are in the process.

This could also be used for the 'class progress'. The app separates classes into three categories: 'Future', 'Past', 'In-Progress', but visually these elements appear the same.


##2: Match between system and the real world
Severity rating: (2)
In general, the app does an adequate job of matching the real world. The language used is quite consistent, 'Grades', 'Reminders', etc. Some symbols, like the 'all courses' use a symbol that is not inherently a reflection of the real world. 


##3: User control and freedom
Severity rating: (3)
There is very little user control on this application. All calendar events and reminders can only be set by the professor, not by the students. There is also no way of 'canceling' or marking reminders as 'done', which can be frustrating for the student.

##4: Consistency and standards
Severity rating: (1)
In general, all fonts, colors, and buttons are stylistically similar. However,the color of the card that represents the class is not consistent with any other header of feature, and is not used anywhere else on the app. The color seems arbitrary, and may cause confusion for the user. Another area of confusion is that there are two distinctly different features on the bottom that have the same name.

##5: Error prevention
Severity rating: (2)
The submission feature offers a mans to edit your submission, which is helpful, but does not necessarily prevent you from making the error in the first place. In general, the user doesn't have much autonomy, so the user does not have much room to make errors.

##6: Recognition rather than recall
Severity rating: (0)
This app relies heavily on recognition, which offers a pleasant experience for the user. All course and assignments are listed out, and rarely do I find myself having to use the search feature provided. This was one of the rare things that I had little problems with. However, some of the information was incorrect (but this is not necessarily a design issue).

##7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
Severity rating: (3)
The app is very difficult to use, mostly because of the implementation of the skeleton feature on the bottom. There are five features: 'CCLE Shared System', 'Calender events', 'Notifications', 'Grades', 'CCLE Shared System'. However, the contents of 'Calender events', 'Notifications', 'Grades', are contigent on which course you choose, but you choose the course in 'CCLE Shared System', which can be a bit confusing. 

##8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
Severity rating: (3)
The app is extremely cluttered. The font size is on the smaller side and a bit difficult to read. There is a default grey background, which isn't inherently bad, but makes the app seem very dull. To make matters worse, multiple shades of grey are used, and it is difficult for any one feature to pop out. 

##9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Severity rating: (1)
Again, there is very little autonomy given to users, so it is difficult to set up opportunities for users to recognize and recover from errors. There are grades, but these are not necessarily errors on the applications part.

##10: Help and documentation
Severity rating: (3)
A help feature does exist, but it is incredibly inefficient, as it redirects you to a link that opens up on your internet browser,rather than in the app. The link you are directed to is stylistically different from the application itself, and once you are in your browser there is no natural way in which you can go back to the application, disrupting user flow.
